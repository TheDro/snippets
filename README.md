# Snippets ðŸ”§

This repo is a collection of short scripts and snippets of code that I use for daily development. It's basically my miscellaneous repository.

## MyDaemon (WIP)

This is a daemon that runs in the background to automatically run commands to remove some tedium from local development. This includes things like running `bundle install`, `db:migrate`, etc. whenever I switch branches.

## Global Shortcuts

`global_shortcuts.ahk` and `hammerspoon.lua` are hotkeys in Windows and MacOS, respectively, that allow me to quickly switch between apps.

## local.rb

`local.rb` is a Ruby file that I use to improve my local Rails development environment. It modifies ActiveRecord's default logging behavior to make it easier to spot slow requests and adds some other gems to improve debugging.
